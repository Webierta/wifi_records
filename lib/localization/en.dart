WIFI RECORDS

Simple app that alerts when the device connects to an unregistered Wi-Fi network while running in the background.

To register a Wi-Fi network, connect to that network and click on the <Save> icon (if it does not appear, that network is already registered).

To delete a registered network, swipe that network to the right of the screen (that does not disconnect you from that network).
